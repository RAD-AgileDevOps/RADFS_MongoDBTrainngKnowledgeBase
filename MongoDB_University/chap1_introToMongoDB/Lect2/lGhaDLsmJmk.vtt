00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830


2
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.860
In this lesson, we'll
talk about Atlas.

3
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.600
You'll learn what Atlas
is, what it's used for,

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.050
and take a look at
the Atlas interface.

5
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.810
Atlas is MongoDB's database
as a service solution.

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.770
It provides functionality to set
up your database in the cloud

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.170
without needing to configure
the fine details yourself

8
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.940
manually using the Shell.

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.280
Atlas also handles
replication, which

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.340
means your database maintains
redundant copies of data

11
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.660
to increase availability.

12
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.560
Let's talk a little bit
about how Atlas works.

13
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.720
Atlas users can
deploy clusters, which

14
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.650
are groups of servers
that store your data.

15
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.150
These servers are
configured in what

16
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.330
we call a replica set, which
is a cluster where each server

17
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.480
stores the same data.

18
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.800
This means that each time you
insert or update a document,

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.840
redundant copies are
stored within the set.

20
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.450
Using a replica set ensures
that if you lose access

21
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.430
to a server in
your cluster you're

22
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.350
not going to lose your data.

23
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.790
All of the servers
in your cluster

24
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.620
exist in the cloud
on the cloud service

25
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.850
provider of your choice.

26
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.640
So why should we use Atlas?

27
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.460
One main reason is the
simplicity of setup.

28
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.820
Atlas manages the details of
creating clusters for you,

29
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.460
which simplifies the
operational overhead of running

30
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.110
a deployment.

31
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.760
The Atlas interface
makes it easier

32
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.060
to manage and deploy MongoDB
across cloud providers

33
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.840
and regions.

34
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
Atlas is also a great way to
experiment with new MongoDB

35
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.940
tools and features.

36
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.700
In this course, you'll connect
to an existing Atlas cluster

37
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.540
and query its data.

38
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.470
You'll also create
your own Atlas cluster

39
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.070
and practice
inserting and updating

40
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.410
documents in your database.

41
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.660
You'll learn how to connect
to Atlas outside the Atlas

42
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.510
interface using compass,
which is a graphical user

43
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.130
interface for MongoDB
and the Mongo Shell.

44
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.570
Atlas has different
pricing levels

45
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.960
depending upon the size
and usage of your database.

46
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.820
In this course, we'll be
using the Atlas free tier,

47
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.690
which allows you to deploy
a free tier cluster.

48
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.540
A free cluster is a
three server replica set

49
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.360
with 512 megabytes of storage.

50
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.605
Free tier clusters never expire.

51
00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.230
Under the free tier,
you'll have access

52
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.590
to a subset of Atlas features
like Charts and Stitch,

53
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.240
which we'll discuss
later in this lesson.

54
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.910
If you're learning
how to use MongoDB

55
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.890
or creating a small
scale application,

56
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.410
the free tier is a great
option for storing your data.

57
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.040
Now that we know what Atlas is
let's take a look at the Atlas

58
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.242
interface.

59
00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.950
Note that the interface
might be a little

60
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.710
different in other lessons, but
the features we'll talk about

61
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.600
should be the same.

62
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.560
The main Atlas page shows
all of your clusters.

63
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.230
We can take a look at the data
in our cluster using the Data

64
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.740
Explorer by clicking
the collections button.

65
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.600
Here, we can see
all of the documents

66
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.110
within our databases and
search for specific documents.

67
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.610
We'll learn more
about how to filter

68
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.080
our data in the next chapter.

69
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.500
Atlas also integrates with
several MongoDB services.

70
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.690
These features are beyond
the scope of this course,

71
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.720
but you can explore them as
you learn more about MongoDB.

72
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.360
You can use the Atlas interface
to connect your cluster

73
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.430
with MongoDB Stitch.

74
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.200
Stitch is a serverless
platform that

75
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.450
makes it easier to use
MongoDB and your web

76
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.740
in mobile applications.

77
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.950
The Charts feature allows you
to create visual representations

78
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.480
of your data.

79
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.760
Atlas also allows you
to configure users

80
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.590
with different privileges
levels in your database.

81
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250
This is important, because
as your database grows larger

82
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.000
you'll want to control
the data users can access.

83
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.430
Let's recap what we
learned in this lesson.

84
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.040
We defined Atlas as a
database as a service

85
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.815
that helps you deploy and
manage MongoDB clusters.

86
00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.190
We learned about
how Atlas stores

87
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.440
data in the cloud in replica
sets to increase availability,

88
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.310
and we looked at some
of Atlas's feature

89
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.100
like the Data Explorer, which
we'll use in this course,

90
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.200
and Stitch and Charts,
which are beyond the scope

91
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.020
of this course.
