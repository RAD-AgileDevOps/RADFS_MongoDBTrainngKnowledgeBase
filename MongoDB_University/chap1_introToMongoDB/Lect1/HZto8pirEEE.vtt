2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.280
Hello.

3
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.360
In this course, we will review
a range of MongoDB capabilities

4
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.100
using a variety of tools.

5
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.200
We hope that using
these tools will

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.600
help better visualize
new concepts

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.970
and allow you to work with
data in different ways.

8
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.550
Here, we will introduce you to
MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Compass,

9
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.200
and the Mongo Shell.

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.470
While we won't dive deeply
into each of these tools,

11
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.990
by the end of the course, you
will have enough knowledge

12
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.200
to continue exploring
MongoDB either independently

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.010
or with our other MongoDB
university courses.

14
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.930
Let's start with Atlas.

15
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.390
MongoDB Atlas is a platform
that provides an interface

16
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.600
to manage and deploy MongoDB
across cloud providers

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.930
and regions.

18
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.140
It was built to launch and
manage your deployments

19
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.890
for you, which simplifies the
operational overhead of running

20
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.480
a deployment.

21
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.460
This type of offering is
called database as a service.

22
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.120
What that means is that
Atlas helps you easily

23
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.120
setup and manage your database
from your Atlas account

24
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.140
on the web.

25
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.690
There are multiple tiers
of Atlas subscriptions.

26
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.090
And for this course, we
will be using the free tier

27
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.560
subscription to set up a
database, view and modify data.

28
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.350
The free tier allows you to
experiment with the platform

29
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.820
at no cost to you.

30
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.790
We will cover Atlas in more
detail later in this chapter.

31
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.000
Another tool that will be
heavily used in this course

32
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.290
is called Compass.

33
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.480
Compass provides a
graphical user interface

34
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.390
that allows you to explore
the data in your database.

35
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.670
It is a great tool to get
a quick view of the shape

36
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.010
and state of your data,
as well as test out

37
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.110
MongoDB features
as you are learning

38
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.750
about the database
and its functionality.

39
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.150
You can use Compass to
optimize query performance

40
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.820
and manage indexes,
among other things.

41
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.070
The interface that you
will see on your machine

42
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.925
may differ from the one that
you see in later lectures.

43
00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:47.800
There has been a number
of updates to Compass

44
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.690
since those lessons
were recorded,

45
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
but all the labs have
been updated accordingly.

46
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.590
Finally, we will
be using the Mongo

47
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.460
Shell, which is an
interactive JavaScript

48
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.043
interface to MongoDB.

49
00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:00.460
You do not need
to know JavaScript

50
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.080
to proceed with this course.

51
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.380
Here, you will learn how to
connect your Atlas instance,

52
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.410
query and update data
using the Mongo Shell,

53
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.260
as well as import a data set
into your own Atlas cluster.

54
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.650
This is the third and
last tool that we will use

55
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.390
to interact with your database.

56
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.390
The Mongo Shell is
great for playing around

57
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.850
with all the features that
the database has to offer,

58
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.830
and really learning
about MongoDB

59
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.290
query language
and functionality.

60
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.750
The following lectures
and labs in this chapter

61
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.820
will walk you through
installing all three

62
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.580
tools that are required
to complete this course.

63
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.890
Please keep in mind that
some of the lectures

64
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.530
may have an outdated
campus or Atlas interface,

65
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.910
or show fewer data
sets in the database.

66
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.460
This will not
impede your ability

67
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.280
to complete the course since
the labs have been updated

68
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.610
accordingly and the tools still
have the functionality that you

69
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.350
will be learning about.

70
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.060
Finally, please
check the lecture

71
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.130
notes that are located
under the videos

72
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.190
as you are going through
the course material.
